## Ask Mr. Grubs  

#### Need information about your food? Ask Mr. Grubs! Mr. Grubs can answer a wide variety of questions such as *How many calories are in an orange* or *How many teaspoons are in a tablespoon.* If Mr. Grubs does not have an answer for you, you can always ask his friend Google! The google feature takes voice commands (by clicking on the microphone icon), as well as text input.
